# meta-calculator
mini project



❖The project entitled as “**Meta-Calculator**” synchronizes the calculations of mathematical formulae.It looks at all the aspects of a calculation.
❖The proposed System is a web based calculator which calculates all the fundamental derivatives on mensuration topics in mathematics.
❖The system uses **HTML,CSS And JAVASCRIPT** as the front-end.
❖There is no back-end to this system.
❖The proposed System is a **web based calculator** which calculates all the fundamental derivatives on **mensuration topics** in mathematics.
❖we do have separate websites to search or calculate a specific topics on mensuration in mathematics but we don't have single website which contains all the formulas and derivatives to calculate it.
❖These limitations have been overcome by creating a **new web-based calculating system**.
❖The system provides an attractive and easy to handle user interface which follows Windows standards.
❖It is highly user friendly.No deep knowledge of computers is required to operate this system.
METHODOLOGY:
In the home page there will be a dropdown listbox which contains the topics on mensuration in mathematics ,by selecting the topic will lead the user to calculation page.In that calculation page input boxes appear ,in that box the user has to enter the respective values to get the answer.
